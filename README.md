# Spring-Boot-REST-API-controller-
Spring Boot REST API controller that manages journal entries â€” so the overall project is typically called something like a:  "Spring Boot Journal App" or "Journal Entry Management REST API"


This project is a Spring Boot REST API designed for managing a simple journal application. It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on journal entries through HTTP endpoints. Each journal entry is represented by a JournalEntry object and stored in an in-memory HashMap for quick access, making this an ideal prototype, demo, or educational tool for learning RESTful web development.

Key Features
Create Entry: Add new journal entries via POST requests.

Read Entries: Retrieve all journal entries or a specific entry by its unique ID.

Update Entry: Modify an existing journal entry given its ID.

Delete Entry: Remove a journal entry by its ID.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Framework for building Java REST APIs with minimal configuration.

Spring Web: For RESTful endpoint creation using annotations like @RestController, @GetMapping, etc.

Java Collections: Stores entries in a HashMap (no external database required for this version).

Example Use Cases
A simple backend for a journal or diary web application.

A teaching resource to demonstrate CRUD operations and RESTful principles.

A starter project for extending with database storage, authentication, or a front-end client.
